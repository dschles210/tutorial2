<h1 style="color:blue;">Destiny's Life</h1>  
<p>I used to live with my dog Jax. My family got Jax from a shelter four years ago. Here is a picture that is similar to how my double-goldendoodle looks.</p>

<p>We adopted Jax from a shelter as shelter dogs can sometimes be the best boys and gorls you can find.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelter dogs deserve love.</li>
<li>Jax was a scared puppy, but quickly became very playful when he realized he was safe.</li>
<li>Shelters are normally overcrowded and the animals need families to show them kindness.</li>
<li>I think buying from the shelter was one of the best things to happen to our family.</li>    
</ul>
